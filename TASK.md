# npm-registry Package Development Task

## Objective
Develop an npm package called "npm-registry" that serves as a central repository for blockchain-related configurations, addresses, and constants across multiple chains, maintaining compatibility with existing systems while improving organization and extensibility.

## Package Purpose
The npm-registry package will contain:
1. Relevant addresses (tokens, services, etc.)
2. Configuration helpers (e.g., for Hardhat networks)
3. ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces)
4. Other constants or "state of the world" type configurations
5. Chain-specific information (name, network type, RPC URLs, explorer URLs)

This package will be used by various projects and clients, both downstream and upstream, as the authoritative source for correct and deployed/configured addresses, states, and other essential information.

## Key Requirements
1. Support for multiple chains (hundreds of mainnets and testnets)
2. Clear separation of chains to allow concurrent work by multiple developers
3. Easy maintenance and updates
4. Consistent structure across all supported chains
5. Efficient access to data for consuming applications
6. Backward compatibility with existing configuration structure
7. Clear distinction between mainnet and testnet networks

## Existing Configuration Structure
The current configuration is stored in a single JavaScript object, with chain IDs as keys. Each chain object contains properties such as:
- name
- network (mainnet/testnet)
- type (e.g., "evm")
- message (address)
- feeToken (address)
- weth (address)
- usdc (address, for some chains)
- rpc (URL)
- explorer (URL)
- Additional chain-specific properties (e.g., Circle-related addresses)

## Proposed New Structure
```
/src
  /chains
    /mainnet
      /<chain_id>.ts
    /testnet
      /<chain_id>.ts
  /abi
    /<contract_name>.ts
  /types
    index.ts
  /utils
    index.ts
  index.ts
```

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
2. Implement utility functions to easily access data across different chains
3. Ensure all chain-specific data is isolated within its respective file
4. Use constants for chain IDs to improve code readability
5. Implement a system for easy addition of new chains
6. Create comprehensive documentation for usage and contribution
7. Maintain backward compatibility with the existing configuration structure
8. Implement a robust error handling system
9. Use interfaces to ensure consistency across different chain implementations

## Next Steps
1. Define interfaces for chain configurations, addresses, and ABIs
2. Create a base chain configuration class/interface that can be extended for specific chains
3. Implement utility functions for data access, including backward-compatible methods
4. Set up a build process for compiling TypeScript to JavaScript
5. Migrate existing chain configurations to the new structure
6. Develop a thorough testing suite, including tests for backward compatibility
7. Write comprehensive documentation, including migration guides for existing users
8. Implement a versioning strategy for the package

## Migration Tasks
1. Create a script to automatically convert the existing configuration to the new structure
2. Implement a compatibility layer to support both old and new configuration access methods
3. Provide clear documentation on how to migrate from the old structure to the new one
4. Create a validation script to ensure all existing data is correctly migrated

## Considerations
- Versioning strategy for the package
- Handling of chain-specific quirks or exceptions
- Strategy for updating deployed addresses and configurations
- Potential for automated updates from on-chain data
- Backward compatibility when making updates
- Performance optimization for large-scale applications
- Security considerations for sensitive data
- Process for adding new chains or updating existing chain information
- Handling of deprecated or removed contracts/addresses

## Data Management
- Implement a system to track the last update time for each chain's data
- Consider implementing a data validation system to ensure the integrity of stored information
- Develop a strategy for handling deprecated or removed contracts/addresses

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for utility functions
2. Integration tests simulating real-world usage scenarios
3. Type checking tests to ensure type safety across the package
4. Performance tests for data access operations
5. Edge case testing for error handling and unsupported chains
6. Backward compatibility tests to ensure existing systems can still access data

## Documentation Requirements
1. README file with installation and basic usage instructions
2. API documentation for all public functions and interfaces
3. Examples of common use cases
4. Contribution guidelines
5. Changelog to track updates and breaking changes
6. Migration guide for users of the existing configuration

## Future Enhancements
1. CLI tool for easy data updates and chain additions
2. Integration with popular blockchain explorers for automated data updates
3. Web interface for easy browsing and updating of chain data
4. Support for custom plugins to extend functionality

Please review this updated task description and provide any feedback or additional requirements. Once finalized, we will use this as a comprehensive guide to implement the actual code and structure of the npm-registry package.
